What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When person initializes a repository, git adds hidden file which contains meta data, which itself
contains the information about the changes maded to this file. The changes will only be saved after
forlder has initilized, prior changes are not trackable by git.
We need this to create version control for our own projects.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is there to help us prepare for the changes to be made, it helps us to decide what change we want to commit.
It is also easier for user to add multiple files to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

With staging area you can separate logical changes. First you add one logical change to staging area,
and then you commit change, afterwards you add second logical change to staging area and commit it too
