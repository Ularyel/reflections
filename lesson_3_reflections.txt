When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a project for which the contribution of 2 or more people is required.
It also is better to share this project for other people's use.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case you are working on one feature and you do not want extra files added by other people in your project.
It can create confusion and software might not compile.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is used to alter the project of other developer and still give them credit for original work.
clone is used to get project from github to your local machine, and branching is used for testing new features
or creating slightly different version of original project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

We can experiment with it before uploading it, thus make stable changes before we share it to public.
