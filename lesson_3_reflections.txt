When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a project for which the contribution of 2 or more people is required.
It also is better to share this project for other people's use.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case you are working on one feature and you do not want extra files added by other people in your project.
It can create confusion and software might not compile.
